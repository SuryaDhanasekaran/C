Data:
    User input.
    Datatypes:
    1.Built-in-Integral(integer,character),Bool,Floating Point(float,double)
    2.Derived(Arrays,Pointers)
    3.User-defined(struct,enum,union)

    Integer:
        whole num +ve,-ve or zero
        
        short int
        unsigned short int
        unsigned int
        int
        long int
        unsigned long int
        long long int
        unsigned long long int

    Character:
        Letter or Number or symbol in single quotes.

            Signed
            Unsigned character
